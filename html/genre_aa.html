    <h1>Action!</h1>

    <h2>What is Action all about?</h2>
    <!-- from https://www.allmovie.com/genre/action-d646 -->
      <p>Action films usually involve one or more heroes who are thrust into a series of challenges
        requiring physical feats, extended fights, extensive stunts, and frenzied chases. Story and
        character development are generally secondary to explosions, fist fights, gunplay, and car chases.
        Action movies are highly popular due to their exciting storylines, and usually center around
        a specific hero that dominates the narrative. Long the most popular of genres among male
        moviegoers, the action picture had been the dominant film genre of American and many foreign
        film markets (notably Hong Kong), since action translates across language barriers.</p>
