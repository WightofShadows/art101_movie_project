    <h2>What is Drama all about?</h2>
    <!-- from https://www.allmovie.com/genre/drama-d649/alltime-desc/3 -->
      <p>Drama is the most broad of cinema's genres and include subgenres such as
        romantic drama, period drama, courtroom drama, and adventure drama, among others.
        At the center of a drama is usually a chracter or characters who are in conflict
         at a crucial moment in their lives. Often revolving around families, dramas dig under
        the skin of everyday life to ask big questions and touch on the deepest
        emotions of normal people. They often, but not always, have tragic or at least painful
        resolutions and concern the survival of some tragic crisis, like the death
        of a family member or a divorce.</p>
