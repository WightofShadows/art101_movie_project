        <h2>What is Science Fiction all about?</h2>
        <!-- from https://www.allmovie.com/genre/science-fiction-d652 -->
          <p>Science Fiction is a genre of film embracing one or more of the following
            elements: speculative fictions, futurism, technology, and space travel. Early
            science-fiction was primarily concerned with man's exploration of the universe,
            but soon found competition in a more paranoif strain of films in the 1950s. Fifties
            science-fiction dealt mostly with invasions of Earth by hostile aliens or giant
            radioactive mutations. Reactions to the testing of the A-bomb and Cold War
            paranoia were often reflected allegorically in these films.The 1960s and '70s
            saw a more hopeful strain of film emerge, as pessimism was briefly replaced again
            by the thrill of space adventure. Mounting ecological concerns, however, led to the
            1970s "ecokill" cycle, featuring natural forces (mostly predatory animals) rebelling
            against their polluted environments. By the 1980s, this strain had evolved into the
            "dystopia" film, which dealt with the aftermath of an ecological or nuclear disaster,
            often speculating the formation of totalitarian governments or man's return to savage
            barbarism. As technology has increased, the ideological content of science-fiction
            film seems to have decreased, with special effects becoming an end in themselves
            rather than a means to make a point. </p>
