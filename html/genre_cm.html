        <h2>What is Comedy all about?</h2>
        <!-- from https://www.allmovie.com/genre/comedy-d6486 -->
          <p>Comedy films are made with the main purpose of amusing viewers and inducing laughter.
            The comedy is usually meant to make the viewer feel good, projecting the foibles of
            characters onto the screen for the audience to use as a scapegoat for the riduculousness
            of life. Always a hugely popular genre, there are many types of screen comedy: slapstick,
            conceptual, satirical, absurd, and anarchic, just to name a few. While many comedys films
            are entirely light hearted, comedy in films can also be an effective way of commenting
            on aspects of society, examining hypocrisies by showing how absurd they are. Comedy as
            a genre is vast, but down below are a few iconic films to start.</p>
